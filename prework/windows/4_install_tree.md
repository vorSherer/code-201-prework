# How to install Tree view for each machine.

## Context:

Tree view allows you to list all directories, sub-directories, and files in a nicely formatted view inside your terminal.

### Windows:

For windows, there are two options. By default, you can use the cmd that comes from windows, but the command is a little long, and the display for it doesn't look that nice. Alternatively, you can download and install a program, and add it to your Path.


#### Option 1: Default tree.

To display the tree view, type: `cmd //c tree`. This only shows the directories and sub directories. If you want to see the files as well, then type `cmd //c tree //f`.




#### Option 2: Install GnuWin Tree view.


**Read through this entire walkthrough at least once before doing it! If you are confused about any steps then feel free to wait until class starts and have a TA walk through this with you :)**

For a nicer layout, you can follow these instructions to download and install a couple  that will allow you to just type `tree` and it will display a nicely formatted layout.

##### Step 1: Download, install, and unzip the needed files.

- Navigate to this site: `http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tree.htm`.
- Next, download the Setup on the line that says:  `Complete package, except sources`. This will download a basic installer for Tree.
- Then, download the binaries zip folder. We need this to add the tree command to our Path.
- There is an image to help point them out [here](https://imgur.com/a/jcznS)
   
- Next, run the installer that you downloaded called `tree-1.5.2.2-setup.exe`. Just select all the default values when prompted. ( Note that the version number may be different.)
- Next, extract or 'unzip' the binaries folder. When it asks you where to extract it to, enter this: `C:/Program Files/Tree`.

##### Step 2: Add the Tree program to your Path.

At this point, you have now installed tree onto your computer, but you still cannot use the command because it's not added to your Path. 
If you were to try to type `tree` in git bash now you would see and error like `bash: tree command not found`. This is becasue git bash doesn't know where to look to find the program that we just installed. By adding it to our path, we will be giving our git bash a direct path to find our tree program.

- Open your system settings. ( On windows 10 you can right click on the start menu and navigate to settings ).

- You should see a search bar. Type `env` and the search will populate with a couple options. Choose the option that says "Edit the System Enviroment Settings".

- A small window will pop-up. At the bottomm, directly above the cancel button, is another button that says Enviroment Variables. Click that.

- Another window will pop-up. This is where you can see all of your enviroment variables. Click on the one that says PATH, and then click edit.

- Finally, this last page will show you all of the things that are attached to your PATH. If you have installed VS Code you may seem it in here! Click on New and you'll see a text entry box appear in the middle of the page. Copy this line :`C:/Program Files/Tree/bin` and paste it in that entry field. Hit enter and then make sure to click Okay on all 3 previous boxes!

Now at this point when you type `tree` in git bash, git bash will look at your path, look in the bin folder, and will find the tree program and will execute it. If it doesn't work then restart your computer and try again.


If it doesn't work, or at any point if you run into difficulties, then stop and let your instructor know. They will help you set this up during the first couple days of class!
