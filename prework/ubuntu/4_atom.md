### Install Atom Text Editor

It's time to install Atom Text Editor, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose.

To get started, run the following command in your terminal to check your operating system’s type:

```
uname -m
```

If your computer is an i386 system, you will not be able to install and use Atom. Please notify an instructor or TA in the Slack channel, and we will help coordinate installing another very similar text editor.

Currently only a 64-bit version is available.

Download atom-amd64.deb from the [Atom Release Page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
Run `sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb` on the downloaded package.

Once installed, launch Atom using Spotlight Search.

### `atom` & `apm` (shell commands)
**atom**

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Atom from the Terminal.

To verify Atom is wired up correctly, run the `atom` command from your terminal.

If Atom opens, you're good to go.

If Atom does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Slack channel.

**apm**

Once you've verified that your `atom` shell command is functional, run the following command in your terminal, from any directory, to install the base packages which will help add additional functionality to your editor.

- `apm install open-in-browser minimap highlight-selected`

This will install the following packages:
1. Open In Browser: `ctrl-alt-q` hotkey to open your HTML page in the browser from Atom
2. Mini-Map: Installs a mini map (useful for seeing your code at a high level) in the right hand column of the editor window
3. Highlight Selected: Highlights all instances of a word or phrase when one instance in double-clicked or cursor-highlighted

### Associate Atom with Git

It's important to establish a default editor with Git, as it's the program that will be used to open up all of your files.

Type the following command in your terminal:
`git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`
