### Install Atom Text Editor

Now it's time to install Atom Text Editor, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download [Atom]([Atom](https://atom.io/)) and drag the app icon into your `/Applications` folder.

**TIP:** Remember to eject the disk image after installing the app.

Once installed, launch Atom using Spotlight Search.

### `atom` & `apm` (shell commands)
**atom**

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Atom from the Terminal.

Navigate to the following menu in Atom: `Atom->Install Shell Commands` (Select this option from the menu, and Atom will alert you when the commands have completed)

To verify Atom is wired up correctly, run the `atom` command from your terminal.

If Atom opens, you're good to go.

If Atom does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Slack channel.

**apm**
Once you've verified that your `atom` shell command is functional, run the following command in your terminal, from any directory, to install the base packages which will help add additional functionality to your editor.

- `apm install open-in-browser minimap highlight-selected linter linter-eslint`

This will install the following packages:
1. Open In Browser: `ctrl-alt-q` hotkey to open your HTML page in the browser from Atom
2. Mini-Map: Installs a mini map (useful for seeing your code at a high level) in the right hand column of the editor window
3. Highlight Selected: Highlights all instances of a word or phrase when one instance in double-clicked or cursor-highlighted
4. Linter - Base Atom Linter (Syntax Validation)
5. esLint - JavaScript-specific Linter which will provide feedback in your JS file showing any syntax errors in your code

### Associate Atom with Git

It's important to establish a default editor with Git, as it's the program that will be used to open up all of your files.

Type the following command in your terminal:
`git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"`

### Congratulations!

Time for a frosty beverage. :beers:
